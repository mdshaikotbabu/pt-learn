What is physiotherapy?

Today we learn about physiotherapy exercise. Why we used physiotherapy exercise for a patient how to it’s working. How to used this treatment. So Let’s go.     

Physiotherapy exercise   is a mean of accelerating the patients recovery from injuries and diseases which have altered his normal way of living.

Classification of physiotherapy exercise

It’s mainly two types:

A. Active physiotherapy exercise

1. Voluntary:

Free active exercise.
Assisted active exercise.
Assisted resisted active
exercise.

Resisted active exercise.      
2. Involuntary:

           a.  Reflex

B. Passive physiotherapy exercise:

Relaxed passive movement.
Passive manual mobilization.
Techniques of passive manual Mobilization-

Mobilization of joint.
Manipulation of joint.
Controlled sustained stretching of tightened structure.
The principal of physiotherapy exercise

The functional exercise: program follows a linear path from  basic mobility to basic stability to movement patterns.
Corrective exercise: falls into one of the three basic categories mobility stability and retraining of movement patterns.
Mobility exercise: focus on joint ROM(range of motion) tissue length and muscle flexibility.
Stability exercise: focus on the basic sequencing of the movement.
Retraining movement patterns: incorporates the use of fundamental mobility and stability into specific movement patterns to reinforce


Aims of physiotherapy exercise:

To increase range of motion.
To prevent joint stiffness.
To prevent deformity.
To increase strength.
To increase muscle power.
To increase endurance.
To maintain muscle strength.
To increase blood circulation.
I.To maintain cardio-pulmonary fitness.
To improve lung function.
To prevent injury.
To reduce performance of any sports.
Objective of physiotherapy exercise

The first objective of physiotherapy exercise is to help the body reduce pain

and inflammation. Once this is achieved the exercise program focuses on

regaining range of motion and rebuilding muscle strength and endurance.
